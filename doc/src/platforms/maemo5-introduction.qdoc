    \brief Documents related to Qt for Maemo 5

    Qt for Maemo 5 is essentially Qt for X11 with deeper integration into the
    Linux and X11-based Maemo 5 platform. It allows applications to be written that
    look and feel native to the Maemo 5 user interface.

    \section1 Required tools

    See \l{Qt for Maemo 5 Requirements} to see what tools are
    required to use Qt for the Maemo 5 platform.

    \section1 Installing Qt and Running Demos

    Follow the instructions found in \l{Installing Qt on the Maemo 5 Platform from a Binary Package}
    to learn how to install Qt using a binary package, and how to build and run Qt demos.

    \section1 Building Your Own Applications

    If you are new to Qt development, have a look at \l{How to Learn Qt}.
    In general, the difference between developing a Qt application for Maemo 5
    compared to any Linux with X11 is not that big.

    See \l{Maemo 5 Examples} for a set of examples showing how to do deeper integration
    with Maemo 5. See \l{Platform Notes - Maemo 5} for a list of platform specific
    behavioral changes.

    qmake is fully supported for Maemo 5 and can be used to build Qt applications.
    qmake will take care of all platform-specific compiler flags required to build
    for a device.
    For more information on how to use qmake have a look at the \l{qmake Tutorial}.

    After running qmake, type "make" to build your application.

    \section1 Running Your Applications in Scratchbox

    Please consult the Maemo 5 documentation about setting up Scratchbox and Xephyr
    to obtain a Maemo 5 emulation environment. Do not forget to set the \c DISPLAY
    environment variable.

    As documented, all Qt applications that are started from the console must be run with
    the "run-standalone.sh" shell script. This script sets up the Maemo 5 environment,
    which is required to enable the Maemo 5 support in Qt.

    Example: Instead of running "./wiggly" to bring up the Wiggly example, you should
    use "run-standalone.sh ./wiggly".

    \note For convenience, "run-standalone.sh" can also be sourced into your current shell
    with "source /usr/bin/run-standalone.sh". In that shell, it is no longer required to
    invoke "run-standalone.sh" on every Qt application launch.

    \section1 Running Your Applications on the Device

    To run an application without installing it on the device, copy it using secure copy
    (scp, requires an ssh server to be installed on the device) or use NFS to mount your
    desktop PC's drives on the device.

    Open the X terminal and execute your application; for example, by typing
    "/home/user/myApp/myApp". The "run-standalone.sh" script is not required. Note
    that applications must be launched as the default user. 

    Note that Maemo 5 does not execute binaries from memory cards. Applications
    must be copied to the internal memory first.

    \section1 Deploying Your Applications

    Maemo 5 uses the Debian package format for installation.  Please refer to the Maemo 5
    packaging documentation (\l{http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_packaging}) for information
    on how to create Debian packages.

    After generating the \c{debian/} packaging directory with \c{dh_make}, the Qt dependency
    should be specified by adding \c{libqt4-dev (>= 4.6.1)} to the \c{Build-Depends} line
    of the \c{debian/control} file. This ensures that the Qt development headers must be
    available in order to build the package.

    For qmake based projects, edit the \c{debian/rules} file and search for the
    \c{configure-stamp:} section. There should be a comment in that section stating
    \c{# Add here commands to configure the package}. After that line, add
    \c{qmake myproject.pro} (replace \c{myproject.pro} with the name of your qmake
    project file). This ensures that qmake is invoked instead of running a configure script.
    Since qmake uses the environment variable \c{INSTALL_ROOT} to redirect installations,
    the default use of the \c{DESTDIR} variable needs to be changed. Look for the \c{install:}
    section in \c{debian/rules} and replace all occurences of \c{DESTDIR} with \c{INSTALL_ROOT}.
