The Qt version 4.6 series is binary compatible with the 4.5.x series.
Applications compiled for 4.5 will continue to run with 4.6.

Some of the changes listed in this file include issue tracking numbers
corresponding to tasks in the Qt Bug Tracker, the (now obsolete) Task
Tracker, or the Merge Request queue of the public source repository.
